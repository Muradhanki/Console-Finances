## About The Project


https://muradhanki.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

Hi everyone! This is Muradhan. I am a construction project manager of 10 years whom always had an interest overt the IT industry. Finally decided to make the switch, and started the EdX's Front end development boot camp to switch his field of work. 

In this assignment, I'll be building my portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework. We have been asked to follow the template below for the reference.

Being a a future front-end developer, I was in need of an portfolio to showcase my projects to prospective clients.

* Using Bootstrap, recreate your portfolio site with the following items:

* The website should include the following bootstrap components:

* A Navigation bar

* A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.

* Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.

* Links should navigate to the appropriate sections
A hero section

A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.
A work section

* A section displaying your work in grid.

If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/
Use bootstrap cards for each project.

The description should give a brief overview of the work.
Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

* A skills section

List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
An about / contact section.

* An "About Me" section in the same row.
* A footer section.

All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.

All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.
